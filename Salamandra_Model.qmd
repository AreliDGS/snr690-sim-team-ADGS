### **Activity 1: Salamander Survival (Partner A) — Station 1 from Week 3**

**Scenario:** A researcher wants to know if canopy cover affects salamander survival in forest fragments. They marked 20 salamanders in each of 12 forest fragments and recorded whether each salamander survived (alive/dead) after one year. Canopy cover was measured as a percentage for each fragment.

**The truth (what we’re simulating):**

-   12 forest fragments

-   20 salamanders per fragment (240 total salamanders)

-   Canopy cover ranges from 40% to 90%

-   True effect of canopy cover on survival probability: for every 10% increase in canopy cover, the log-odds of survival increases by 0.09

-   We’ll use a logistic relationship (since survival is binary), but don’t worry about the math - just run the code and comment what each line does
